\subsection{cloud.google.com/go/bigquery@v1.7.0}

This is a simple build error, but interesting in that it shoudl be
catchable with checks during code review. It could be that it is for
``this is how the code WILL look'', or other code having changed since
merge.

\begin{verbatim}
# cloud.google.com/go/bigquery/reservation/apiv1beta1
/go/pkg/mod/cloud.google.com/go/bigquery@v1.7.0/reservation/apiv1beta1/reservation_client.go:728:111: req.GetBiReservation undefined (type *reservation.UpdateBiReservationRequest has no field or method GetBiReservation)
    Build of cloud.google.com/go/bigquery/reservation/apiv1beta1 failed
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{cloud.google.com/go/pubsub@v1.0.0}

This error is because the go.sum file for this specific version of the
module genuinely does not contain any data for
golang.org/x/time/rate. On the flip side, there is no go.mod file for
golang.org/x/time/rate, but there is one for golang.org/x/time, so
there's something a bit weird happening here.

Not surprising, we are seeing two build targets failing on the same
thing, both included for completeness sake.

\begin{verbatim}

	go get github.com/kisielk/sqlstruct

\end{verbatim}

This is due to a go.mod file that does NOT contain any of the
dependencies. This release also does not have a go.sum file, meaning
that repeatability in build is not guaranteed (actually, pretty much
the opposite).
