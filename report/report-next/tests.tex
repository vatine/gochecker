This seems to be an outright mistake in the code. Looking at the
datatransfer.TransferConfig type definition, I can't find any instance
at which it has a member named that. The closest is that there's a
{\tt Destination} struct member typed as a package-internal interface,
with an exported type named {\tt TransferConfig_DestinationDatasetId}
that, in turn, has a {\tt DestinationDatasetId} struct member.

I am not at all sure why we're seeing this error message. At the 1.3.0
version, there is a go.mod for {\tt github.com/stretchr/testify}, and
there is none for the {\tt assert} subdirectory.

This is a pretty classic Go error message. There is an unused
variable, which (for good or bad) is a compile error.

In this specific case, it is in an example, but it looks like the test
file has actual tests in addition to the examples.

This is one of those Go vet checks that have been promoted to ``flag
as a failure during tests''. There are a few more of those and as a
general rule, some code from ``before this was enabled'' may still
have it.

This is a pre-module package, failing to build in many ways. This
seems to be the root of the test failure in this case.
